# Introduction to DevOps 

## What is DevOps?

Directly taken from: `https://landing.google.com/sre/books/`


"**[DevOps Engineers]** apply the principles of computer science and engineering to the design and development of computing systems: generally, large distributed ones. 
Sometimes, our task is writing the software for those systems alongside our product development counterparts; sometimes, our task is building all 
the additional pieces those systems need, like backups or load balancing, ideally so they can be reused across systems; and sometimes, our task is figuring out how to apply
 existing solutions to new problems."
