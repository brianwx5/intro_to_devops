# Linux Scripting - Continued


## Section I - Introduction

The previous section had you use `vi` or `vim` to write scripts. 

This is an important skill to have because sometimes you may not have an IDE available 
and you want to automate a task **quick and dirty** or for **functionality testing**.

**Stay away from quick and dirty solutions**, generally you want to ensure that your code
is saved in source control, such as Git/GitHub, such that you can for example `git pull` your
`repo` onto a server or a virtual machine and execute it. 


- ***Refresher***: Generally, do scripts have an "explict" compile step
- ***Refresher***: Why are you able to pull script's source code from from a repository and generally
just execute it? 

Always apply good software development practices to your scripts!

For our purposes, it's okay to do what we're doing since we're learning, but folks in this business can
relay horror stories.

## Section II - Activity I - CentOS Setup IDE

We're going to install PyCharm and use that to different scripts in the subsequent activities.

To reiterate the sentiments in the introduction, be sure to test your scripts on resources
you are comfortable with "breaking." 

We're working on our own virtual machine so, if 
it breaks we can simply rebuild it, no harm done.
